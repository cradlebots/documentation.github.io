# 🚀 Going Live: Acquiring a Dedicated Bot 🤖

To obtain a dedicated bot that's not shared via a keyword, you'll need to meet specific prerequisites:

## Requirements:

1. 📝 **KYC Document**: A Know Your Customer (KYC) document is essential for identity verification and ensuring your bot's security.

2. 🗝️ **Initial Keyword**: You should specify the initial keyword that was associated with your dedicated bot.

3. 🔒 **HTTPS Callback URL**: A secure HTTPS callback URL is mandatory for receiving and handling incoming requests from users. This ensures data security and encryption during interactions.

4. 🖼️ **Profile Picture (Optional)**: While not mandatory, it's recommended to set a profile picture for your bot, which can be used as the Display Picture (DP). This adds a personal touch to your bot and can enhance user engagement.

## Application Process:

Once you meet the criteria above, you can proceed with the following steps to acquire your dedicated bot:

1. 📄 **Document Submission**: Provide your KYC document to verify your identity and the legitimacy of your application.

2. 🗝️ **Keyword Selection**: Specify the initial keyword that was associated with your dedicated bot.

3. 🌐 **Callback URL Configuration**: Set up a secure HTTPS callback URL to handle user interactions and messages. This URL serves as the bridge between your bot and our services.

4. 🖼️ **Profile Picture**: If desired, set a profile picture for your bot, which will serve as its Display Picture (DP).

5. 📧 **Application Submission**: After fulfilling the requirements and configuring your bot, send an email to [collscodes@gmail.com](mailto:collscodes@gmail.com) to initiate the application process.

Please note that the application and approval process may take some time as we verify the provided information and set up your dedicated bot. Rest assured that this procedure is in place to ensure a secure and reliable experience for both you and your bot's users.
