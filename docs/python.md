# üåê Handling a Request: Implementing Custom Callbacks

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a custom URL to handle HTTP POST requests effectively on your web server. Creating a callback URL is a vital step in seamlessly integrating your application with our services.

## üîë Key Considerations for Callback Handling

When configuring a custom callback, it's crucial to keep the following key points in mind:

- **Session Management**: Each request we send to you will include a unique session ID, which remains active for 3 minutes (180 seconds). Sessions are automatically terminated after this duration.

- **Session Completion**: You must inform us whether a session is ongoing or complete. For ongoing sessions, initiate your response with "CON." When it's the final response for that session, start your reply with "END."

- **Error Handling**: In the case of an HTTP error response (status code 4XX) from your script or a malformed response that doesn't begin with "CON" or "END," we will gracefully terminate the session.

- **Menu Content**: Ensure that your menu content doesn't contain special characters, as some telcos may have difficulty rendering such content. This could potentially disrupt access to your USSD services.

### üìü API Parameters

The API initiates an HTTP POST request to your server with the following parameters, which you can extract from the form fields of the request. The content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This request is triggered when a user interacts with your WhatsApp bot.

## üöÄ Request Parameters

- **sessionID**: A unique value generated at the beginning of a session, and it is sent with each mobile subscriber's response.

- **phoneNumber**: The phone number of the mobile subscriber interacting with your SMS/WhatsApp bot.

- **networkCode**: The telco network code associated with the phone number interacting with your bot.

- **serviceCode**: A unique code assigned to your application.

- **text**: This field represents user input. It is an empty string in the initial notification of a session. Subsequently, it concatenates all user input within the session with an asterisk (*) until the session concludes (e.g., 1*colls*24).

## üìú Sample python Script


Here is a sample Python script to handle incoming requests:
```python

import os
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/bot", methods=['POST'])
def bot():
    # Read the variables sent via POST from our API
    session_id = request.values.get("sessionId", None)
    serviceCode = request.values.get("serviceCode", None)
    phone_number = request.values.get("phoneNumber", None)
    text = request.values.get("text", "default")

    if text == '':
        # This is the first request. Note how we start the response with CON
        response = "CON Welcome to animal offsprings, select a category to continue\n1. Domestic Animals\n2. Wild Animals"

    elif text == '1':
        # Business logic for the first-level response
        response = "CON Choose an animal to know its offspring\n1. Cow\n2. Chicken\n3. Dog"

    elif text == '2':
        # Business logic for the first-level response
        response = "CON Choose an animal to know its offspring\n1. Cow\n2. Chicken\n3. Dog"

    elif text == '1*1':
        # This is a second-level response where the user selected 1 in the first instance
        # This is a terminal request. Note how we start the response with END
        response = "END The young one of a Cow is a calf"

    else:
        response = "END Invalid choice"

    # Send the response back to the API
    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```
